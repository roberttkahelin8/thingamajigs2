Things to remember and look out for:
- This is not to be used for a crash report. Crashes and bugs are two completely different things, and one is more serious than the other.
- This mod may not support all mod loaders. You will know if it doesn't if the game crashes and a mod loader says that a certain file is not for it's loader in a crash log.
- Upload logs to PasteBin so they don't clutter the issue reports page. You can set them to disappear in a week, or longer time, instead of permanently up and public.
