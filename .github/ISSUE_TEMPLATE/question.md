**Descriptive Question Must Be Put Here**
Clear and concise question about a specific feature. It could turn out to change a feature.

**Screenshots To Help Explain Question Further (Max of 2-4 please, make your images less than 1080p/1080x720px if possible)**
Add screenshots to make the question your asking make more sense (optional unless requested later on).

**Version Of Mod Question Is For (NeoForge only):**
 - Thingamajigs Version [e.g. v1.7.3, 1.7.3, etc.]

**Additional Info & Context**
Add any other notable things you want to say that relate to the question.

Things to remember and look out for:
- This is not a bug/crash/any other kind of a report. It is a question template only, and must be used for **questions only**.
- Questions must not be duplicates of other questions. Search in the issues tab if this question was already asked, then add your points there instead of making a new open issue.
- Try to make screenshots smaller but not too small so that file space is saved for all users. 720x480px is small enough but not too large, but text should be visible (yes it was wrote twice on purpose).
- If the question leads to an issue other than a question, it may need to be converted to a bug/crash report. Thus, one will be opened if the question ends up revealing a bug or oversight of some sort. Consensus requires reporter and one moderator/code helper to approve in order to create new issue report.
