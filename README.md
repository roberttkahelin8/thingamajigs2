# Thingamajigs 2
What is this? This is Thingamajigs 2, the mod that will continue Thingamajigs into MC 1.21+.

Thingamajigs 2 is more open than Thingamajigs 1. It contains old features but is more polished in other aspects, such as better code management and organization, along with condensing down multiple Java files with similar code.
Anyways, look at the source if you are trying to make something similar! All code except images, plain text (like this file) and some other types of files are NOT free use.
As long as you give credit back to this mod, you can use code snippets or entire java files (with modifications to parameters name and exclusion of the 'Thingamajigs' mod name; remove the name, basically).
If your unsure how you can use the code, just ask about it.

What happened to the features?
A lot of old features were redone again. Others are coming back in future addons.


Planned Addons:
Thingamajigs Goodies (Converter, Purifying items and Other Misc. Magic or otherwise things)

Thingamajigs Road Stuffs (asphalt blocks, paint, and custom signs!) (not the final name as other mods already have this name minus Thingamajigs)

Thingamajigs Railroadways (custom rails and infiminecart return!)


Updated/Changed Feature Backstory:
Note that mostly *custom* features broke in 1.21+, resulting in this drastic change for 1.21+ versions. The DJ Laser Light was almost cancelled because of the changes to a lot of MC's code and the modloader's code.


The *official name* of this mod is **Thingamajigs 2**.

## Not So FAQ:

Q1: Are we cancelling Thingamajigs 1?

A: NEVER! That mod is *far* too popular (well, it is to my eyes). The mod will continue to be updated till we can't physically update it anymore (health and life, etc., and such).

Q2: Is X feature coming back/being added?

A: Perhaps, if it is on the planned addons list or is an approved, brand new feature.

Q3: Who is 'we'?

A: Whoever works on this mod and whoever contributes code/artwork/ideas to the mod. There are a few people who have given good ideas, and they have been thanked very much.

Q4: Can I help out?

A: Sure! If you want to suggest an idea, open a new suggestion in the 'Issues' tab. If you want to suggest a code improvement, open a "Pull Request" (with your changed code), especially if a mod has some issue (compat-wise) with this mod.

Q5: Where can I support your development efforts?

A: There is a donate link in this README at the top. The values for donating are quite low, along with a custom option to allow you to specify whatever you want or what you think this mod deserves.


Features not mentioned or are seemingly silently not discussed:
These features are features which are not coming back. Due to the nature of how tedious it is to update these features, they have been scrapped. It's sad, but true. This includes the following features:
- Dyed Pumpkin Stems, Carved/Jack O Lanterns, and associated items
- Other older mod features that never made it past conceptual phase

Currently supported versions (MC and Modloader): NeoForged MC 1.21

Open a suggestion if you want to, or (if the mod is already released) submit a bug/crash report if you experience problems!

NOT AN OFFICIAL MINECRAFT PRODUCT. NOT AFFILIATED WITH MOJANG STUDIOS OR MICROSOFT.
